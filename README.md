# About this App

I designed this app with a friendly user flow while not forgetting a clean responsive design and functionality without user errors. As a result, a user can comfortably sign up/sign in, create their own apparel, look at the weather, and get a random clothes for the user to wear base on what the user have in their apparels section. Each apparel create can only select from one of the following four: coat, jacket, sweater, shirt.
