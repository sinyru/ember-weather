# General Approach I Took
The approach that I have with this is to do research, trials and errors.
The fact that I had no experience ember prior hand, I spent alot of time doing research and how to implement ember. I broke down the app into pieces. I work on each piece till the piece is succesfully implemented. Then, I will go on to the other.

I designed this app with a friendly user flow while not forgetting a clean responsive design and functionality without user errors. As a result, a user can comfortably sign up/sign in, create their own apparel, look at the weather, and get a random clothes for the user to wear base on what the user have in their apparels section. Each apparel create can only select from one of the following four: coat, jacket, sweater, shirt.

# Technologies Used
  - Ember - framework for this app and as well as usage of ember data
  - ajax - making request to server to acquire,post,delete data
  - bootstrap - styling
  - html - ITS HTML!
  - JavaScript - ember uses javascript, so yes.


# User Stories
## As a User, I would like to:
  - sign up
  - sign in
  - sign out
  - change password
  - have all buttons working
  - able to check the weather temp
  - see if it's raining, sunny, snowing, etc.
  - check all locations within US
  - can add in clothes to my account
  - can remove clothes to my account
  - can update clothes to my account
  - get random clothes

# Installation instructions
  - Fork and clone this repository.
  - Install with npm install.
  - Install with bower install.

# Unsolved Problems or Major Hurdles
There are many unsolved problems since this is ember. I am not sure how to approach this project if I were to make routes nested. I want to make a route with multiple models.
As for Major Hurdles, I have a hard time understanding ember. With a single change or implementation, I had to go to at least four different files to make the component/action happen.

# Proposed Architecture
I would love to have the app implemented with Angular, React, and other frameworks to see the pros and cons of Ember.
